#Learn Git Like 5 Year Old

This repository is meant to provide a beginner-friendly introduction to Git, a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes to your code.

What is Git?

Git is a version control system that lets you keep track of changes to your code over time. It was created by Linus Torvalds, the same person who created Linux, and has become the most popular version control system in use today.
Why use Git?

There are many benefits to using Git, including:

    Version control: Git allows you to keep track of changes to your code over time, so you can easily roll back to a previous version if something goes wrong.

    Collaboration: Git makes it easy to collaborate with others on a project, even if you're not working in the same location.

    Branching and merging: Git allows you to create different "branches" of your code, so you can work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. You can then merge these branches back into the main codebase when you're ready.

Getting Started


Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim who had a big toybox filled with all sorts of toys, from cars to dolls to blocks. Every day, Tim would play with his toys and make changes to them. Sometimes he would add new pieces, and other times he would take some away.

One day, Tim realized that he wanted to keep track of all the changes he made to his toys over time. He wanted to be able to go back and see what his toys looked like before he made changes, just in case something went wrong.

That's when Tim discovered Git, which was like a magical book that could help him remember all the changes he made to his toys. Every time Tim made a change to a toy, he would write it down in the magical book. This way, he could easily look back and see what changes he made.

Tim also learned that Git could help him create different versions of his toybox, just like different branches of code in a software project. For example, he could have one version of his toybox that was just for playing with dolls, and another version that was just for playing with cars. This way, he could keep his toys organized and separate.

Finally, Tim learned that Git could help him collaborate with his friends on his toybox. If he had a friend who wanted to play with his toys too, they could create a separate version of the toybox just for them. Then, they could both make changes to their own versions of the toybox without interfering with each other's work.

From then on, Tim was very happy knowing that he had Git to help him keep track of his toys and play with his friends. And he never had to worry about losing track of all the changes he made to his toys ever again!

Advanced Git

    Rebasing:

Rebasing is like rearranging blocks in a tower. It lets you change the order of your work so that it looks neater and more organized.

    Resetting:

Resetting is like hitting the undo button on a toy car. It lets you go back to an earlier version of your work, so you can fix any mistakes you made along the way.

    Cherry picking:

Cherry picking is like picking your favorite parts from different toys and putting them together to make a new one. It lets you choose specific changes you want to use without having to use everything else.

    Stashing:

Stashing is like putting your toys away in a box for safekeeping. It lets you save your work without having to finish it right away, so you can come back to it later.

    Aliases:

Aliases are like nicknames for commands. They let you give your toys funny names to make them easier to remember and play with.

    Hooks:

Hooks are like magic spells that you can use to help you play with your toys. They let you automate tasks like cleaning up your toys or putting them away when you're done playing.

    Submodules:

Submodules are like special toy parts that you can use to make different toys. They let you use the same toy part in different toys without having to make the same toy part over and over again.
