# Learn Git Like 5 Year Old

This repository is meant to provide a beginner-friendly introduction to Git, a version control system that allows you to keep track of changes to your code.

## What is Git?

Git is a version control system that lets you keep track of changes to your code over time. It was created by Linus Torvalds, the same person who created Linux, and has become the most popular version control system in use today.

##Why use Git?

There are many benefits to using Git, including:

    Version control: Git allows you to keep track of changes to your code over time, so you can easily roll back to a previous version if something goes wrong.

    Collaboration: Git makes it easy to collaborate with others on a project, even if you're not working in the same location.

    Branching and merging: Git allows you to create different "branches" of your code, so you can work on new features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. You can then merge these branches back into the main codebase when you're ready.

## Getting Started


Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Tim who had a big toybox filled with all sorts of toys, from cars to dolls to blocks. Every day, Tim would play with his toys and make changes to them. Sometimes he would add new pieces, and other times he would take some away.

One day, Tim realized that he wanted to keep track of all the changes he made to his toys over time. He wanted to be able to go back and see what his toys looked like before he made changes, just in case something went wrong.

That's when Tim discovered Git, which was like a magical book that could help him remember all the changes he made to his toys. Every time Tim made a change to a toy, he would write it down in the magical book. This way, he could easily look back and see what changes he made.

Tim also learned that Git could help him create different versions of his toybox, just like different branches of code in a software project. For example, he could have one version of his toybox that was just for playing with dolls, and another version that was just for playing with cars. This way, he could keep his toys organized and separate.

Finally, Tim learned that Git could help him collaborate with his friends on his toybox. If he had a friend who wanted to play with his toys too, they could create a separate version of the toybox just for them. Then, they could both make changes to their own versions of the toybox without interfering with each other's work.

From then on, Tim was very happy knowing that he had Git to help him keep track of his toys and play with his friends. And he never had to worry about losing track of all the changes he made to his toys ever again!

# Git Basics

    git init:

Once upon a time, Tim decided to build a new toybox from scratch. He had all sorts of new toys he wanted to play with, but he needed a place to put them. So, he decided to use Git to help him keep track of his new toybox.

He started by using the "git init" command, which was like waving a magic wand to create a new empty toybox that he could fill with all his new toys. This command created a new Git repository in his toybox folder, which he could use to track all the changes he made to his toys over time.

    git add:

Tim had a new toy he wanted to add to his toybox, a shiny red sports car. He had just finished building it and wanted to keep track of all the changes he made to it over time.

To do this, Tim used the "git add" command, which was like picking up his new car and putting it in his toybox. This command added his new car to the Git repository so that he could keep track of all the changes he made to it over time.

    git commit:

As Tim played with his toys, he continued to make changes to his new red sports car. He added new wheels and a spoiler, and he even painted it yellow.

To remember all the changes he made, Tim used the "git commit" command, which was like taking a snapshot of his car at that moment in time. This command saved all the changes he made to the Git repository, along with a message explaining what he did.

    git status:

Tim wanted to check what toys he had in his toybox, and which toys he had made changes to. To do this, he used the "git status" command, which was like asking his toybox which toys were inside and which ones he had recently played with.

This command showed him the current status of his Git repository and which files had been changed since the last commit.

    git log:

One day, Tim realized he had made a mistake when he painted his car yellow. He wanted to go back to the previous version of the car, the one with the red paint.

To do this, he used the "git log" command, which was like flipping through his magical Git notebook to find the snapshot of his car from before he painted it yellow.

This command showed him a list of all the previous commits he had made, along with their messages. He was able to find the commit where he added the yellow paint and then use another Git command to undo that change.

These are just a few of the basic Git commands Tim learned. With these commands, he was able to keep track of all the changes he made to his toys and play with them even better than before!

##  Advanced Git

    Rebasing:

Rebasing is a Git command that allows you to modify the order and organization of your work. Imagine you have a collection of toy blocks that you have been stacking up. Rebasing would be like rearranging these blocks so that they are more organized and easier to manage. For example, you could take some blocks from the middle of the stack and move them to the top, or you could separate certain blocks into their own separate piles.

    Resetting:

Resetting is a Git command that allows you to revert your work to an earlier state. It's like hitting the undo button on a toy car, which would allow you to go back to an earlier version of the car before you made any mistakes. With Git, you can use the reset command to undo a series of changes or even revert to an earlier commit, which is like going back in time to a previous version of your toy.

    Cherry picking:

Cherry picking is a Git command that allows you to select specific changes from one branch and apply them to another branch. It's like picking your favorite toy parts from different toys and combining them to make a new toy. For example, you might have a toy car with a cool spoiler that you want to add to a different toy car. With cherry picking, you can select just the spoiler and add it to the new car, without having to add any other changes.

    Stashing:

Stashing is a Git command that allows you to temporarily save your work without committing it to your repository. It's like putting your toys away in a box for safekeeping. With stashing, you can save your work and come back to it later, without having to commit it to your repository. For example, you might be working on a new toy but have to switch to a different task. With stashing, you can save your progress on the toy and come back to it later, without having to commit it to your repository.

    Aliases:

Aliases are a Git feature that allows you to create custom shortcuts or nicknames for Git commands. It's like giving your toys funny nicknames to make them easier to remember and play with. For example, you might create an alias called "toybox" for the "git status" command, so that you can quickly check the status of your repository by typing "git toybox" instead of "git status".

    Hooks:

Hooks are a Git feature that allows you to automate certain tasks or actions when specific events occur. It's like using magic spells to help you play with your toys. For example, you might create a hook that automatically runs a code linter or formatter whenever you commit changes to your repository. This would help ensure that your code is always clean and consistent.

    Submodules:

Submodules are a Git feature that allows you to include one repository within another repository as a subdirectory. It's like using special toy parts to create different toys. For example, you might have a toy car repository that includes a submodule for the toy engine. This would allow you to use the same engine in multiple toy car repositories without having to duplicate the code.

I hope this helps you understand these Git concepts better, just like playing with toys in different ways!
